# Parkinson's Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting Parkinson's Disease using vocal features extracted from voice recordings. It utilizes machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and SVM for classification, along with Explainable AI (XAI) techniques like SHAP and LIME for model interpretability.

## üß† Project Objective

To build a robust machine learning model capable of predicting the presence of Parkinson's Disease using biomedical voice measurements and make the predictions explainable to end-users and clinicians.

   - Train-test split

2. **Model Building**
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

3. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

4. **Explainability**
   - SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
   - LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
